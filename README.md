# Walmart_Sales_Prediction_And_Analysis
<b>#Designed and implemented a machine learning model to predict Walmart sales, leveraging data analysis to enhance inventory management and business strategy.<br><b>
• Technologies Used: Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebooks.<br>

Store - the store number<br>
Date - the week of sales<br>
Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store<br>
Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week<br>

<b>#Acknowledgements:</b>The dataset is taken from Kaggle.<br>

<b>#Objective: </b><br>
Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).<br>
Build Regression models to predict the sales w.r.t a single & multiple feature.<br>
Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.
